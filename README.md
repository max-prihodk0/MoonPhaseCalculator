# MoonPhaseCalculator
This is a simple program that I made to help me with my science class in 9th grade. It will calculate the exact moon phase on the date provided using a simple algorithm.

The date syntax is as follows: ```<month> <date> <year>```. The variable `month` can be either all lowercase or capitalized (e.g. January, january). You also need to change the variable for the next full moon for this to work accurately.
